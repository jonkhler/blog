# simple markdown blogging framework

I like simplicity in design. As such this is a simple markdown blogging framework that builds upon [prior work](https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/) adding some bells and whistles:

1. automatically include entries via `@include path/to/files`
2. sort entries by creation time and add some timestamp
3. keep the build a minimum `make clean; make all; make install`
4. store the state on github itself
