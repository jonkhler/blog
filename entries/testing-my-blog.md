### A little test

I am trying to build a simple blog that is fully automated and 100% reliant on Markdown for the sake of beauty and simplicity.

Let us try to write some latex and see if this works

$$ f(x) = x^2 $$

Ok math works - let's move over to some code

```python
# let us test a simple python function 
def foo(a: int, b: int):
    return a + b
```

```c++
// and maybe a simple c++ function as well
int foo(int a, int b) {
    return std::max(a) * b;
}
```

#### Subheader

Let's see how deep we can push the nesting here
